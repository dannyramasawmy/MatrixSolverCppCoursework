# MatrixSolverCppCoursework
Coursework from 2016 to create a matrix solver with c++.

### Part A
The task was to complete a Matrix base class, which had a testing script but no implementation. 
The aim was to provide a header file and source code file which compiled with the test script to correctly execute it. 

### Part B
The aim of this part of the coursework was to create a SquareMatrix Class which inherits the functionality of the Matrix class defined in Part 1. 
The SquareMatrix class is a special case of the Matrix class where the noOfRows and noOfDimensions are equal. 

### Part C
This built upon the previous classes to create a matrix solver for least squares approximations.

The code was able to be compiled and every function works correctly with the test script provided. This work recieved top marks.
